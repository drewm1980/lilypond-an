A template to write a score for a diatonic accordion.

- There is a horizontal staff indicating if the accordion must be
pushed (thick line) or pulled (thin line)

- There is a small rhythmic staff with lyrics that describes the bass
buttons to press. The bar lines are made from gridlines

- The tabulator staff for diatonic accordions shows the geographic
position of the buttons and not (as for every other instrument) the
pitch of the notes; the keys on the melody-side of the accordion are
placed in three columns and about 12 rows


In the tabulator staff notation the outermost column is described with
notes between lines, the innermost column is described with notes
between lines and a cross as accidental, and the middle column is
described with notes on a line, whereby the row in the middle is
represented on the middle line in the staff.


Some words to transpose piano notes to the diatonic accordion:


1. Every diatonic accordion is built for some keys only (for example,
for the keys of C major and F major), so it is important to transpose a
piano melody to match one of these keys. Transpose the source code, not
only the output because this code is required later on to translate it
once more to the tabulator staff. This can be done with the command
@code{displayLilyMusic}.


2. You have to alternate the push- and pull-direction of the accordion
regularly. If the player has a too long part to pull the accordion gets
broken. On the other hand, some harmonies are only available in one
direction. Considering this, decide which parts of the melody are the
push-parts and which the pull-parts.


3. For each pull- or push-part translate the piano notes to the
according tabulature representation.


This snippet comes with a useful optional macro for the jEdit text
editor.

			% The beam between 8th-notes is used to draw the push-line
			%How to fast write the push-lines: 
			%	 1. write repeatedly 'c c c c c c c c |' for the whole length of the song 
			%	 2. uncomment the line \NoNoteHead
			%	 3. compile
			%	 4. Mark the positions on which push/pull changes. 
			%	    In the score-picture click on the position the push- or pull-part starts 
                        %           (on the noteHead, the cursor will change to a hand-icon).
			%	    The cursor in the source code will jump just at this position.
			%	  a) If a push-part starts there, replace the 'c' by an 'e['
			%	  b) If a pull-part starts there, replace the 'c' by an 's'
			%	 5. Switch into 'overwrite-mode' by pressing the 'ins' key. 
			%	 6. For the pull-parts overwrite the 'c' with 's' 
			%	 7. For every push-part replace the last 'c' with 'e]' 
			%        8. Switch into 'insert-mode' again 
			%	 9. At last it should look lik e.g. (s s e[ c | c c c c c c c c | c c c c c c e] s s)
			%	10. re-enable the line \NoNoteHead
			\autoBeamOff
			\ZeroBeam 
			 s8 s s e[ c c c c c c e] | s s s s s
