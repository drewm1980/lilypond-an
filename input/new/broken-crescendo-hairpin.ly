In order to make parts of a crescendo hairpin invisible, the following
method is used: A white rectangle is drawn on top of the respective
part of the crescendo hairpin, making it invisible.  The rectangle is
defined as postscript code within a text markup.

To fine-tune the position and size of the markup, the number
preceding @code{setgray} in the postscript definition can be set to a
value less than one, making it grey.  The two numbers before @code{scale}
in the postscript code are responsible for the width and height of the
rectangle, the two numbers before @code{translate} change the x- and
y-origin of the rectangle.

Make sure to put the hairpin in a lower layer than the text markup to
draw the rectangle over the hairpin.
