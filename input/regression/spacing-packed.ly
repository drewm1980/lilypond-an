	In packed mode, pack notes as tight as possible.  This makes
	sense mostly in combination with ragged-right mode: the notes
	are then printed at minimum distance.  This is mostly useful
	for ancient notation, but may also be useful for some flavours
	of contemporary music.  If not in ragged-right mode, lily will
	pack as many bars of music as possible into a line, but the
	line will then be stretched to fill the whole linewidth.
