/** A symbol which is attached between two columns. A spanner is a
    symbol which spans across several columns, so its final appearance
    can only be calculated after the breaking problem is solved.

    Examples

    * (de)crescendo
    * slur
    * beam
    * bracket

    Spanner should know about the items which it should consider:
    e.g. slurs should be steep enough to "enclose" all those items. This
    is absolutely necessary for beams, since they have to adjust the
    length of stems of notes they encompass.
