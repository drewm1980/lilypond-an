/** a group of individually translated symbols. You can add stencils
    to the top, to the right, etc.

    It is implemented as a "tree" of scheme expressions, as in

    Expr = combine Expr-list
    | translate Offset Expr
    | origin (ORIGIN) Expr
    | no-origin Expr
    | (SCHEME)
    ;

    SCHEME is a Scheme expression that --when eval'd-- produces the
    desired output.

    Notes:

    * Because of the way that Stencil is implemented, it is the most
    efficient to add "fresh" stencils to what you're going to build.

    * Do not create Stencil objects on the heap. That includes passing
    around Stencil* which are produced by unsmob_stencil(). Either
    copy Stencil objects, or use SCM references.

    * Empty stencils have empty dimensions.  If add_at_edge is used to
    init the stencil, we assume that

    DIMENSIONS = (Interval (0, 0), Interval (0, 0)
