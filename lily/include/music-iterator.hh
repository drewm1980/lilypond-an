   ---

   Music_iterator is an object type that traverses the Music structure and
   reports the events it finds to interpretation contexts. It is not yet
   user-serviceable.


   ---

   Conceptually a music-iterator operates on a queue of musical events
   that are pending. This queue does not actually exist, but it is a
   way of viewing and traversing music-expressions.


   ok () -- events left ?

   pending_mom () -- time tag of the next event to be processed.
   PRECONDITION: this->ok () holds.

   process (M) -- process all at M (Precondition: no events exist
   before M, this->ok () holds).  Side-effects:

   * This removes all events at M from the pending queue.

   * Typically this reports the music to an interpretation context,
   thus changing the state of the interpretation context.

   merge pending_moment and process?
