This section provides information and references which are helpful
when writing for unfretted string instruments, principally
orchestral strings.

@node Common notation for unfretted strings
@subsection Common notation for unfretted strings

There is little specialist notation for unfretted string
instruments.  The music is notated on a single staff, and
usually only a single voice is required.  Two voices might
be required for some double-stopped or divisi passages.

Most of the notation which is useful for orchestral strings
and other bowed instruments is covered elsewhere:

@itemize

@item Textual indications such as @qq{pizz.} and @qq{arco} are
added as simple text -- see @ref{Text scripts}.

@item Fingerings, including the thumb indication, are described
in @ref{Fingering instructions}.

@item Double stopping is normally indicated by writing a chord,
see @ref{Chorded notes}.  Directives for playing chords may be
added, see @ref{Arpeggio}.

@item A template for a string quartet can be found in
@rlearning{String quartet}.  Others are shown in the snippets.

@cindex open string indication
@cindex string, indicating open

Bowing indications are created as articulations, which are
described in @ref{Articulations and ornamentations}.

The bowing commands, @code{\upbow} and @code{\downbow}, are used
with slurs as follows:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
c4(\downbow d) e(\upbow f)
@end lilypond

@noindent
and the following example shows three ways in which an open A
string on a violin might be indicated:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
a4 \open
a^\markup { \teeny "II" }
a2^\markup { \small "sul A" }
@end lilypond

@strong{@i{Natural harmonics}}

@cindex note heads, diamond-shaped
@cindex diamond-shaped note heads
@cindex natural harmonics
@cindex harmonics, natural
@funindex \harmonicsOn
@funindex \harmonicsOff

Natural harmonics can be notated in several ways.  A diamond-shaped
note head generally means to touch the string where you would stop
the note if it were not a diamond.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
d4 e4.
\harmonicsOn
d8 e e
d4 e4.
\harmonicsOff
d8 e e
@end lilypond

Alternatively a normal note head is shown at the pitch to be
sounded together with a small circle to indicate it should be
played as a harmonic:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
d2^\flageolet d_\flageolet
@end lilypond

A smaller circle may be created, see the snippet list in
@ref{References for unfretted strings}.

@strong{@i{Artificial harmonics}}

@cindex artificial harmonics
@cindex harmonics, artifical

Artificial harmonics are notated with two notes, one with a normal
note head indicating the stopped position and one with an open
diamond note head to indicate the harmonic position.

@c TODO If the default for harmonicDots is changed, change this
Artificial harmonics indicated with @code{\harmonic} do not show the
dots.  The context property @code{harmonicDots} should be set if
dots are required.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
<e a\harmonic>2.  <c g'\harmonic>4
\set harmonicDots = ##t
<e a\harmonic>2.  <c g'\harmonic>4
@end lilypond

@warning{@code{@bs{}harmonic} @strong{must} be placed inside a
chord construct even if there is only a single note.  Normally
@code{@bs{}harmonicsOn} would be used in this situation.}
