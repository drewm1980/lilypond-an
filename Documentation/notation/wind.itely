Many notation issues for wind instruments pertain to breathing and
tonguing:

@itemize
@item Breathing can be specified by rests or @ref{Breath marks}.
@item Legato playing is indicated by @ref{Slurs}.
@item Different types of tonguings, ranging from legato to non-legato to
stacatto are usually shown by articulation marks, sometimes combined
with slurs, see @ref{Articulations and ornamentations} and @ref{List of
articulations}.
@item Flutter tonguing is usually indicated by placing a tremolo mark
and a text markup on the note. See @ref{Tremolo repeats}.
@end itemize

There are also other aspects of musical notation that can apply to wind
instruments:

@itemize
@item Many wind instruments are transposing intruments, see
@ref{Instrument transpositions}.
@item The slide glissando are characteristic of the trombone, but other
winds may perform keyed or valved glissandi. See @ref{Glissando}.
@item Harmonic series glissandi, which are possible on all brass
instruments but common for French Horns, are usually written out as
@ref{Grace notes}.
@item Pitch inflections at the end of a note are discussed in @ref{Falls
and doits}.
@item Key slaps or valve slaps are often shown by the @code{cross} style
of @ref{Special note heads}.
@item Woodwinds can overblow low notes to sound harmonics. These are
shown by the @code{flageolet} articulation. See @ref{List of articulations}.
@item The use of brass mutes is usually indicated by a text markup, but
where there are many rapid changes it is better to use the
@code{stopped} and @code{open} articulations. See @ref{Articulations and
ornamentations} and @ref{List of articulations}.
@item Stopped horns are indicated by the @code{stopped} articulation.
See @ref{Articulations and ornamentations}.

@node Fingerings
@unnumberedsubsubsec Fingerings
@c TODO add link to LSR snippet by Libero Mureddo once he has added
@c it (after August 15th).
All wind instruments other than the trombone require the use of several
fingers to produce each pitch.

LilyPond contains special definitions for music for the Scottish
highland bagpipe; to use them, add

@example
\include "bagpipe.ly"
@end example

@noindent
at the top of your input file.  This lets you add the special grace notes
common to bagpipe music with short commands.  For example, you could
write @code{\taor} instead of

@example
\grace @{ \small G32[ d G e] @}
@end example

@code{bagpipe.ly} also contains pitch definitions for the bagpipe
notes in the appropriate octaves, so you do not need to worry about
@code{\relative} or @code{\transpose}.

@lilypond[ragged-right,verbatim,quote,notime]
\include "bagpipe.ly"
{ \grg G4 \grg a \grg b \grg c \grg d \grg e \grg f \grA g A }
@end lilypond

Bagpipe music nominally uses the key of D Major (even though that
isn't really true).  However, since that is the only key that can be used,
the key signature is normally not written out.  To set this up correctly,
always start your music with @code{\hideKeySignature}.  If you for some
reason want to show the key signature, you can use @code{\showKeySignature}
instead.

Some modern music use cross fingering on c and f to flatten those notes.
This can be indicated by @code{cflat} or @code{fflat}.  Similarly, the
piobaireachd high g can be written @code{gflat} when it occurs in light
music.
