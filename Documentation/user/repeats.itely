@lilypondfile[quote]{repeats-headword.ly}

Repetition is a central concept in music, and multiple notations
exist for repetitions.  LilyPond supports the following kinds of
repeats:


@table @code
@item volta
The repeated music is not written out but enclosed between repeat bar
lines.  If the repeat is at the beginning of a piece, a repeat bar
line is only printed at the end of the repeat.  Alternative endings
(volte) are printed left to right with brackets.  This is the standard
notation for repeats with alternatives.

@item unfold
The repeated music is fully written out, as many times as
specified by @var{repeatcount}.  This is useful when
entering repetitious music.

@item percent
These are beat or measure repeats.  They look like single slashes or
percent signs.

@item tremolo
This is used to write tremolo beams.

@node Long repeats
@subsection Long repeats

This section discusses how to input long (usually multi-measure)
repeats.  The repeats can take two forms: repeats enclosed between
repeat signs; or written out repeats, used to input repetitious music.
Repeat signs can also be controlled manually.

@node Normal repeats
@unnumberedsubsubsec Normal repeats

The syntax for a normal repeat is

@example
\repeat volta @var{repeatcount} @var{musicexpr}
@end example

where @var{musicexpr} is a music expression.  Alternate endings can be
produced using @code{\alternative}.  In order to delimit the alternate
endings, the group of alternatives must be enclosed in a set of
braces.  If there are more repeats than there are alternate endings,
the earliest repeats are given the first alternative.

Normal repeats without alternate endings:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
\repeat volta 2 { c4 d e f }
c2 d
\repeat volta 2 { d4 e f g }
@end lilypond

Normal repeats with alternate endings:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
\repeat volta 4 { c4 d e f }
\alternative {
  { d2 e }
  { f2 g }
}
c1
@end lilypond

Repeats with upbeats can be entered in two ways:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
\partial 4

\repeat volta 4 { c2 d | e2 f | }
\alternative {
  { g4 g g e }
  { a4 a a a | b2. }
}
@end lilypond

@noindent
or

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
\partial 4
\repeat volta 4 { e4 | c2 d | e2 f | }
\alternative {
  { \partial 4*3 g4 g g }
  { a4 a a a | b2. }
}
@end lilypond


@cindex repeats with ties
@cindex alternative endings with ties
@cindex ties in repeats

Ties may be added to a second ending:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]

\repeat volta 2 { c4 d e f ~ }
\alternative {
  { f2 d }
  { f2\repeatTie f, }
}

A nested repeat like

is ambiguous, since it is is not clear to which @code{\repeat} the
@code{\alternative} belongs.  This ambiguity is resolved by always
having the @code{\alternative} belong to the inner @code{\repeat}.
For clarity, it is advisable to use braces in such situations.

Timing information is not remembered at the start of an alternative,
so after a repeat timing information must be reset by hand; for
example, by setting @code{Score.measurePosition} or entering
@code{\partial}.  Similarly, slurs are also not repeated.

or by printing the relevant bar lines.  For more information, see
@ref{Bar lines}.}

The property @code{repeatCommands} can be used to control the
layout of repeats.  Its value is a Scheme list of repeat commands.

@table @code
@item start-repeat
Print a @code{|:} bar line.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
c1
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'(start-repeat)
d4 e f g
c1
@end lilypond

As per standard engraving practice, repeat signs are not printed
at the beginning of a piece.

@item end-repeat
Print a @code{:|} bar line:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
c1
d4 e f g
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'(end-repeat)
c1
@end lilypond

@item (volta @var{number}) ... (volta #f)
Create a new volta with the specified number.  The volta bracket must
be explicitly terminated, or it will not be printed.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
f4 g a b
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta "2"))
g4 a g a
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta #f))
c1
@end lilypond

@end table

Multiple repeat commands may occur at the same point:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
f4 g a b
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta "2, 5") end-repeat)
g4 a g a
c1
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta #f) (volta "95") end-repeat)
b1
\set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta #f))
@end lilypond

@cindex volta bracket with text
@cindex text in volta bracket

Text can be included with the volta bracket.  The text can be a
number or numbers or markup text, see @ref{Formatting text}.  The
simplest way to use markup text is to define the markup first,
then include the markup in a Scheme list.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote]
voltaAdLib = \markup { 1. 2. 3... \text \italic { ad lib. } }
\relative c'' {
  c1
  \set Score.repeatCommands = #(list(list 'volta voltaAdLib) 'start-repeat)
  c4 b d e
  \set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta #f) (volta "4.") end-repeat)
  f1
  \set Score.repeatCommands = #'((volta #f))
}

By using the @code{unfold} command, repeats can be used to simplify
the writing out of repetitious music.  The syntax is

@example
\repeat unfold @var{repeatcount} @var{musicexpr}
@end example

where @var{musicexpr} is a music expression and @var{repeatcount} is
the number of times @var{musicexpr} is repeated.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
c1
\repeat unfold 2 { c4 d e f }
c1
@end lilypond

Unfold repeats can be made with alternate endings.  If there are
more repeats than there are alternate endings, the first
alternative ending is applied to the earliest endings.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]

\repeat unfold 2 { g4 f e d }

@node Short repeats
@subsection Short repeats

This section discusses how to input short repeats.  Short repeats can
take two basic forms: repeats of a single note to two measures,
represented by slashes or percent signs; and tremolos.

@unnumberedsubsubsec Percent repeats

@cindex percent repeats
@cindex measure repeats

@cindex repeat, short
@funindex \repeat percent
@funindex percent

Repeated short patterns of notes are supported.  The music is printed
once, and the pattern is replaced with a special sign.  Patterns that
are shorter than one measure are replaced by slashes, and patterns of
one or two measures are replaced by percent-like signs.  The syntax is

@example
@code{\repeat percent @var{number} @var{musicexpr}}
@end example

where @var{musicexpr} is a music expression.

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
\repeat percent 4 { c4 }

@knownissues

Only three kinds of percent repeats are supported: a single slash
representing a single beat (regardless of the duration of the repeated
notes); a single slash with dots representing one full measure; and
two slashes with dots crossing a bar line representing two full
measures.  Neither multiple slashes representing single beat repeats
consisting of sixteenth or shorter notes, nor two slashes with dots
representing single beat repeats consisting of notes of varying
durations, are supported.


@node Tremolo repeats
@unnumberedsubsubsec Tremolo repeats

@cindex tremolo beams
@cindex tremolo
@cindex repeat, tremolo
@funindex \repeat tremolo
@funindex tremolo

Tremolos can take two forms: alternation between two chords or two
notes, and rapid repetition of a single note or chord. Tremolos
consisting of an alternation are indicated by adding beams between the
notes or chords being alternated, while tremolos consisting of the
rapid repetition of a single note are indicated by adding beams or
slashes to a single note.

To place tremolo marks between notes, use @code{\repeat} with
tremolo style:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,relative=2]
\repeat tremolo 8 { c16 d }
\repeat tremolo 6 { c16 d }
\repeat tremolo 2 { c16 d }
@end lilypond

The @code{\repeat tremolo} syntax expects exactly two notes within
the braces, and the number of repetitions must correspond to a
note value that can be expressed with plain or dotted notes.  Thus,
@code{\repeat tremolo 7} is valid and produces a double dotted
note, but @code{\repeat tremolo 9} is not.

The duration of the tremolo equals the duration of the
braced expression multiplied by the number of repeats:
@code{\repeat tremolo 8 @{ c16 d16 @}} gives a whole note tremolo,
notated as two whole notes joined by tremolo beams.

There are two ways to put tremolo marks on a single note.  The
@code{\repeat tremolo} syntax is also used here, in which case
the note should not be surrounded by braces:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim,ragged-right]
\repeat tremolo 4 c'16
@end lilypond

@cindex tremolo marks
@funindex tremoloFlags
@funindex :

The same output can be obtained by adding
@q{@code{:}[@var{number}]} after the note.  The number indicates
the duration of the subdivision, and it must be at least 8.  A
@var{number} value of 8 gives one line across the note stem.  If
the length is omitted, the last value (stored in
@code{tremoloFlags}) is used
